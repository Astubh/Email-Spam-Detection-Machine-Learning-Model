# Email-Spam-Detection-Machine-Learning-Model
This is a Machine Learning Model which uses Naive Bayes algorithm for the Classification of Email as Spam or Ham/Not Spam.
In this model there are two parts one of them is the test model of any input mail.
Second is the test of Email directly from Gmail account using the API of Gmail provided by Google.
I have used the Spam dataset available on Kaggle to train and test the model.
